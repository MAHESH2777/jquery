<!-- Explanation

The live() method attaches one or more event handlers for selected elements, and specifies a function to run when the events occur

The live() method was deprecated in jQuery version 1.7, and removed in version 1.9. We have used an earlier version of jQuery (1.7 in the script tag), for this example to work.

Advantage of using live() is that it uses the concept of event bubbling.
The live() method attaches the event handler to the root level of the document along with associated selector and the event information. This can also respond to the events which are generated by dynamically added elements.
